# Transcribe Tonic

The Python code provided defines a module called `transcribetonic.py` that contains a class `TranscribeTonic`. This class is designed to perform automatic speech recognition (ASR) using Hugging Face's Transformers library. It employs the `distil-whisper/distil-large-v3` model from the library to transcribe audio files into text. Here is a simple guide and example usage of how to utilize the `TranscribeTonic` class for transcribing audio content.

## Prerequisites:
Before using the `TranscribeTonic` class, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install torch transformers pytest
```

## Code Description:
- **Class Initialization (`__init__`)**: The class initializes a model designed for speech-to-text transformation. It automatically selects the computing device (GPU if available; otherwise CPU) and the data type (`torch.float16` for GPU to optimize memory, and `torch.float32` for CPU).
- **Transcription Method (`transcribe`)**: This method takes the path to an audio file as input and returns the transcribed text as output. It uses a processing pipeline configured with the model.

## Example Usage:
Here's how you can use the `TranscribeTonic` class to transcribe audio files:

```python
# Assuming transcribetonic.py is already created and includes the TranscribeTonic class.

from transcribetonic import TranscribeTonic

def main():
    # Initialize the transcriber
    transcriber = TranscribeTonic()
    
    # Path to your audio file
    audio_file_path = "path_to_your_audio_file.wav"
    
    # Transcribing the audio file to text
    transcribed_text = transcriber.transcribe(audio_file_path)
    
    # Print the result
    print("Transcribed Text:", transcribed_text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Notes:
- Make sure that the audio file format is supported by Hugging Face's ASR models.
- The transcription might take some time depending on the length of the audio and the computing power available.

## Tests:
The provided code setup also includes unit tests in `test_transcribetonic.py` which can be run using `pytest` to ensure functionality of the transcriber. It validates basic functionality, error handling, and the configuration of the device and data types.

That's how you can integrate and use the `TranscribeTonic` class for speech-to-text applications, harnessing the powerful ASR capability of transformers in Python. This allows applications ranging from automated transcription services, voice command interfaces, to more complex audio processing tasks.
